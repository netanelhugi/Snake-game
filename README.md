# Snake-game


## **Computer architecture course project**

**About the project:**</br>
In this project we build a 'snake' game by Processing,
and connect between the game and</br>
microcontroller(Tiva C Series TM4C123G LaunchPad).</br>
With the microcontroller we will control the movement of the snake by the chip buttons,</br>
and we'll see when the snake close to the wall when the light on the chip will turn on.


**How to run:**</br>
Clone the repository to your computer,</br>
and follow the instructions.

**For Keyboard version:**</br>

You can see the code in the folder:</br>
>/Keyboard-version/snake</br>

open "snake.pde" (Processing file) or "snake.java".

**How to play:**</br>

*in Windows:*</br>

open the folder:
>/application.windows32 </br>

or </br>

>/application.windows64 </br>

and run "snake.exe".


*in Linux:*</br>

load "snake.pde" file in Processing, and press "run".</br>


**For Microcontroller version(Only tested on our Tiva LaunchPad):**</br>

You can see the code in the folder:</br>

>"Microcontroller-version/snake"</br>

open "snake.pde" (Processing file) or "snake.java".


**How to connect the microcontroller:**</br>

Install Energia software.</br>
Connect the chip to your computer by USB.</br>
Load </br>
>/energia/EnergiaChipSync.ino</br>
to Energia and sync.</br>


**How to play:**

in Windows:
open "application.windows32"/"application.windows64" folder
and run "snake.exe".

in Linux:
load "snake.pde" file in Processing, and press "run".
