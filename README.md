# Snake-game


## **Computer architecture course project**

**About the project:**</br>
In this project we build a 'snake' game by Processing,
and connect between the game and</br>
microcontroller(Tiva C Series TM4C123G LaunchPad).</br>
With the microcontroller we will control the movement of the snake by the chip buttons,</br>
and we'll see when the snake close to the wall when the light on the chip will turn on.


**How to run:**</br>
Clone the repository to your computer,</br>
and follow the instructions.

**Keyboard version:**</br>

You can see the code in the folder:</br>
>"Keyboard-version/snake"
open "snake.pde"(Processing file)</br>
or "snake.java".

**How to play:**
in Windows:
open:
>"application.windows32"/"application.windows64" 
folder
and run "snake.exe".

in Linux:
load "snake.pde" file in Processing, and press "run".

**Microcontroller version(Only tested on our Tiva LaunchPad):**
The code you can see in the folder:
"Microcontroller-version/snake"
open "snake.pde"(Processing file)
or "snake.java".

**How to connect the microcontroller:**

Install "Energia" software.
Connect the chip to your computer by USB.
Load "EnergiaChipSync.ino" to Energia and sync.

**How to play:**

in Windows:
open "application.windows32"/"application.windows64" folder
and run "snake.exe".

in Linux:
load "snake.pde" file in Processing, and press "run".
